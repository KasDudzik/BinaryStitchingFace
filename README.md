## About The Project
This project is a watch face for [Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/watchfaces/) - an Open Source E-Paper Watch. I came up with a concept of translating the time into binary numbers which are used to generate a Hitomezashi Stitch Patterns. This visual way of showing the time gives us total of **1440** (24*60) different patterns, each for every hour and minute of the day. Top row represents the hour, and the column on the left shows current minute. The pattern is generated by drawing dashed lines for every digit. Those lines are offset based on weather the digit is 1 or 0. 
There are two versions of this face:

### Basic Face
This version translates decimal numbers representing current hour and minute into binary numbers.

### Version Two
This version individually translates every decimal digit representing current hour and minute into binary numbers. So first 4 bits are tens, and next 4 bits are units. It's easier to read than the Basic version.

## Getting The Watch Face

### Watchy Setup
If you'd like to use those watch faces firstly make sure to follow [Watchy's Getting Started](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started/) instructions. I highly recommend using **PlatformIO** setup as my project was written using this compiler.

### Put The Face In Your Watch
1. It'd be good for you to install PlatformIO or PlatformIO extension for your IDE if possible.
2. Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/KasDudzik/BinaryStitchingFace.git
```
3. Open the folder of the face you'd like to upload (<ins>not whole repo foler!</ins>) using PlatformIO or IDE with PlatformIO extension. The dependencies should downolad automatically.
5. Connect your Watchy via USB.
4. Upload the face 
```sh
pio run -t upload
```
5. Enjoy ~
